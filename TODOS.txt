- Fix some visuals.
- Fix d4 effects on tainted character maybe?
- Forgotten essence effect is kind of a placeholder, need something more interesting.
- Sack of lucky pennies might be bugged.
- Maybe fix the issue with omega tech where it activates both both J+E if they both have it.
- Check if kindness/lilith essence charm story bosses.
- Essence items can give copies, maybe fix that or make sure they all stack.
- Need to test reloading game w/ items
- Maybe add some sound effects to items.
- The fix for respawning essence collectors isnt very elegant, maybe improve this. Maybe deal damage to it?

Here's this code bc its always necessary:
for i = 0, Game():GetNumPlayers() - 1 do
        local player = Game():GetPlayer(i)

if spear then
            local sprite = spear:GetSprite()
            sprite:Load("gfx/pontius_spear_throw.anm2", true) -- Load your custom animation
            sprite:Play("LargeRedLaser", true) -- Ensure correct animation plays
        end
